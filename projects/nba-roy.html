        <h2>Can Machine Learning Predict the Next NBA Rookie of the Year?</h2>
        <p>Every season, the NBA's best young talent competes for the <strong>Rookie of the Year (ROY)</strong> award. While raw scoring ability often catches the public's eye, the award is about more than just points. Team success, efficiency, and overall impact all play a role. But can machine learning help us predict the next winner?</p>
        
        <p>In this project, I built a model to forecast the 2025 NBA Rookie of the Year, using historical ROY data and advanced analytics. By analyzing past winners and their performance metrics, my goal was to develop a data-driven approach to predicting the league's top rookie.</p>

        <h2>How the ROY Race is Decided</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, voters consider factors such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Per Game (PTS)</strong> ‚Äì Scoring is a key factor in the award race.</li>
            <li><strong>Minutes Per Game (MPG)</strong> ‚Äì More playing time often means greater impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Percentage (USG%)</strong> ‚Äì Measures how much of a team‚Äôs offense runs through the rookie.</li>
            <li><strong>Over Replacement Player (VORP)</strong> ‚Äì A metric that evaluates a player's overall contribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Shares Per 48 Minutes (WS/48)</strong> ‚Äì A measure of efficiency and impact on team success.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using these factors, I gathered rookie performance data and created a machine learning model to predict future ROY winners.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Collection & Feature Selection</h2>
        <p>To build the model, I compiled data from past NBA Rookie of the Year winners, focusing on key statistics that correlated with past selections. After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), I identified the most important features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Points Per Game (PTS)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Minutes Per Game (MPG)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Usage Percentage (USG%)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Offensive Box Plus-Minus (OBPM)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These variables formed the basis for my predictive model.</p>
        
        <h2>Model Development & Performance</h2>
        <p>After testing multiple models, Random Forest Regression provided the best performance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R¬≤:</strong> 74.81%</li>
            <li><strong>LOYOCV Accuracy:</strong> 81%</li>
            <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> 0.1537</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This model outperformed others in predicting past ROY winners and was ultimately chosen to forecast the 2025 ROY race.</p>
        
        <h2>Predicting the 2025 NBA Rookie of the Year</h2>
        <p>Applying my trained model to the 2025 NBA rookie class, the projected Rookie of the Year is:</p>
        <h3>üèÜ Stephon Castle</h3>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance sports analysis and prediction. While no model is perfect, data-driven insights provide a structured way to evaluate the ROY race. The model successfully identified past winners and projects <strong>Stephon Castle</strong> as the 2025 Rookie of the Year.</p>
